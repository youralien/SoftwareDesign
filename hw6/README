Playing with Fire - Inspired by the original Playing with Fire and Bomberman

Set-up:
To play this game, pygame must be installed. To do this, use the terminal and type in: sudo apt-get install python-pygame. No other installations are needed.

Objective:
Blow up your opponent before they blow YOU up!


Select the number of players and level to start the game. Blow up your opponents using bombs before they manage to kill you. Destroy blocks to leave behind power-ups which will give you special abilities when picked up. Each player has three lives so they will need to be killed three times to be eliminated. There is a 3-minute time limit in place. If you win a game, you will score the number of seconds remaining on the timer multiplied by 250, times the number of opponents in the game. Losing a game will result in that amount of points being subtracted from your score
